<h1>Introduction</h1>

When editing Java source files, the SIndex plugin enables jEdit to show
the JavaDoc API html documentation for the currently selected word, with
a single key press.<p>

Before the first use, you have to create an keyword index on the Java
libraries that you frequently use. Usually this will be <tt>classes.zip</tt>
or <tt>rt.jar</tt> (depending on your JDK version), but it can be any other
ZIP or JAR file as well, and as many as you wish.<p>


<a name="general"></a>
<h1>Usage</h1>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

You need at least:

<ul>
  <li>jEdit 3.1final</li>
  <li>JDK 1.1.6</li>
  <li>InfoViewer 1.0 -- needed to display the API html documentation.</li>
</ul><p>

You should use the <b>Plugin Manager</b> to download and install the
plugins. Or, you can download and install the plugins manually from
<a href="http://plugins.jedit.org">PluginCentral</a>.<p>


<h3>Creating an index</h3>

On the first use of SIndex, it will automatically present you a
configuration dialog. Use this dialog to create a list of JAR and ZIP files.
These files will be scanned for all members in all classes, creating a fast
index. Use the dialog to associate the JAR/ZIP files with the location of API
documentation. The location of the API doc may be a folder or any valid
URL.<p>

(TODO: more documentation)<p>


<h3>Using an index</h3>

There are three ways of using SIndex:

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
    <b>As a standalone window.</b><br>
    Choose <b>Plugins&gt;SIndex&gt;SIndex</b>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    <b>Docked in the view.</b><br>
    Look at <b>Global Options&gt;Docking</b> and set the entry
    for SIndex to something different from "floating".
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    <b>Only on demand.</b><br>
    Don't open any window or docked panel, just use
    <b>Plugins&gt;SIndex&gt;SIndex on current word</b>.
    SIndex looks up the current selection in its index and
    opens the corresponding JavaDoc API documentation. If there is no
    current selection, the word that the cursor is on is selected.
    If the word is ambiguous, a chooser dialog is shown.<br>
    You can set a keyboard shortcut for this action. I recommend
    <b>S+F1</b>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul><p>

(TODO: more documentation)<p>


<a name="faq"></a>
<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h3>I doubleclicked on an entry, but nothing happens?</h3>

You need to install the InfoViewer plugin to actually view any API doc.<p>


<h3>The index is not loaded/not created, and the activity log says
<tt>OutOfMemoryError</tt>.</h3>

SIndex ran out of free memory during load/create, or rather Java, in
this case. Java ran so much out of memory, it could not even display an
error box telling you so. The error box would have given you the
following advice:<p>

<blockquote>
  You need to increase the maximum memory size of the Java virtual machine.
  Try setting the option "<tt>-Xmx</tt><i>&lt;size&gt;</i><tt>m</tt>" in the
  command line that starts jEdit.<p>

  Note: Set <i>size</i> to the amount of memory you want to
  reserve for the Java virtual machine in megabytes. The default
  is 32 megabytes. You may want to increase it to 64 or higher.<br>
  Note, that this sets the <i>maximum</i> heap size. Java doesn't
  necessarily needs to allocate that much memory, it's an upper
  limit.<p>

  More information about this option can be found in the documentation of
  the Java virtual machine.<p>
</blockquote>


<h3>Why is it so slow on first use?</h3>

If you use SIndex for the first time in the current jEdit session, SIndex
has to load the index file. If you created an index for the JDK 1.2 API,
it is at least 3 MB large, which takes some time for loading.<p>

Second, if you use the internal browser (jEdit HelpViewer) for API browsing,
this takes some time, too. The internal browser is slower than an external
one. You might want to change this in the SIndex options.<p>

Luckily, the index loads in a new thread, so you can continue to work
with jEdit during load.<p>


<h3>I noticed some entries in the index for the JDK API, there are no HTML
files for it in the Sun API documentation.</h3>

Actually, there are a <i>lot</i> of these entries: all <tt>com.sun.*</tt>
and <tt>sun.*</tt> entries have no documentation. Sun chooses to hide their
"intellectual properties" from us, although they made a lot of classes
and methods there public. SIndex simply indexes all public access classes
and methods, whether there is documentation for it or not. SIndex does
this using Java reflection.<p>

Another way to exclude undocumented entries would be to parse the
documentation files, but this is much harder than reflection.<p>

You might as well ask Sun, why such interesting packages as
<tt>com.sun.tools.javac</tt> are hidden from us...<p>


<h3>How can I open the HTML files in an already running instance of
Netscape?</h3>

You can configure this via the <b>InfoViewer</b> plugin. See the plugin
options for InfoViewer and the InfoViewer documentation.<p>


<h3>When I create an index, I get some errors saying
<tt>java.lang.VerifyError</tt> or <tt>java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError</tt>
in the Activity Log.</h3>

These errors occur occasionally, when the ZIP/JAR file for which you
create an index was created with a different JVM as jEdit currently runs
under. For example, jEdit runs under JDK 1.2, and you want to create an
index for <tt>jdk1.1.8/lib/classes.zip</tt>. Or vice versa (which doesn't
really make any sense).<p>

Try to run jEdit under the same JVM as the ZIP/JAR files were created for.<p>

You can safely ignore these errors, since SIndex will leave out
the entries with errors, and create valid index entries for the rest.<p>


<h3>What if I relocate one of the libraries or the documentation folder,
after I created an index? Do I have to recreate the index?</h3>

No, you don't.<p>

You can safely relocate both the libraries and the documentation folders.
If you moved a documentation folder to another location, simply change
the corresponding entry in the SIndex options.<p>
